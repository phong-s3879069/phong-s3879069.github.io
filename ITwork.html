  <h2 class="w3-wide">IT Work</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">
    As my interviewee, he is a Hanoi University of Science and Technology professor as well as a software developer. At University, he teaches students about IT knowledge, specifically, software developer and programming language. On the other hand, he is also a businessman, he sells his products related to IT to companies. 
  </p>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">
    His dominant occupation is an IT lecturer so he interacts with students at university most of the time. After teaching at university, he also works with other IT professionals to develop his products in order to sell for the clients and investors.
  </p>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time?</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">
    He spends most of his time for work at university such as preparing lecture slides, tutorial activities, exercises for his students. Besides, through meetings with the clients and investors, he assembles information, learns about customers and then based on it, he gathers and teaches students.
  </p>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">
    As my interviewee said, working with clients is the most challenging thing because he is forced to obey the 3 rules triangle which are time, budget and quality. From his perspective, his target is always to maximize profit, but for clients, they always want the cheapest price but good quality. For instance, he used to work with Vim, he worked with the investors who pay for his product but they have no knowledge about the major language and are not fully aware of how it works technically. So he has to find a way to change to common phrases in order to deliver.
