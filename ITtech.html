  <h2 class="w3-wide">Machine Learning</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>What is it?</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Machine learning is based on artificial intelligence (AI) that collects datas, learns more knowledge for the system from sample data, experience and users’ usage, activities in order to improve, predict, give suggestions, and make decisions without being programmed. Machine learning algorithms have been used in a large range of applications where basic algorithms are not able to deal with some difficult and unfeasible tasks. In addition, the purpose of using machine learning is to allow the machines to learn automatically without human help.
  </p>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>What is the state of the art of Machine Learning?</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">There is no unique algorithm able to express all forms of machine learning issues, so the state of the art is challenging to spot. The requirement for automated learning algorithms ranges widely from one project to another. However, there is a few of the performing algorithms in certain ways as follows in their relevant applications: 
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">• Neural networks: the optimal outcome is for strong customisation.
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">• SVM + kernel: sort of identical but better to the Neural Net variant. Will work well with low customization and knowledge specifications. 
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">• Tree of decisions: quick, rule-based, hereditary, yet rather unpredictable. [5]
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">There are some examples in our life you may know that use Machine Learning such as advertisements, food recommendations, app suggestions, voice assistant, etc.  For instance, app recommendations that machine learning provides, people may explore new things, find themselves interested. The operation of machine learning is firstly, it collects the data of the applications the users have installed before like the category of it, what kind of purpose the application is for. From that, machine learning algorithms will learn and give recommendations that are related to those downloaded applications suitable with the user’s favourite.
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Another example, that is providing advertisements. This is very popular with most of the applications that use machine learning such as Youtube. Whenever you watch something, there automatically will be some ads that have the same content and are closed to the video such as Beer Advertisement when you watch a video about food. Youtube also uses machine learning to identify a video’s content and assign appropriate keywords for the search. The name of this machine learning model is Feature-Keyword[3]. Youtube applied machine learning algorithms into their system to manage the purpose of the video and the delivery of content contained in it. If it is not appropriate, then machine learning will automatically delete the video. This is also applied to many other applications such as Tiktok where there is a variety of content.  
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">For the next 3 years, automation formed by machine learning will eliminate certain workers, yet many more will be generated and altered. Jobs can use multiple talents in the future and will include higher educational credentials. Economics can be grown dramatically by automation and AI, that means thousands of people around the world will have to change their mind into different careers or develop their knowledge. There is a rational theory that enterprises should not implement automated systems until the cost of acquiring and deploying them is better (cheaper) than the cost of employment. There is a significantly greater change for potential jobs in emerging economies. On the other side, positions such as executives and administrators can potentially become a must-have position. This concerns not only IT and computer-related specialists, but also physicists, scientists, account managers, etc.
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Machine learning can lead greatly to the advancement of human life in the manufacturing, wellbeing and transport sectors. These are the ways in which Machine Learning is already outstanding and can boost our social lives in the future with the aid of AI, so more machines and AIs will do the work or take control of those jobs as workers. This will be even better for younger generations compared to the older generation since they would need to learn how to deal with computers and equipment. Personally, machine learning has been making my life so much more convenient and happy for me because by its benefits, it gives me recommendations based on my demand. Machine learning was used to identify needless and unwished emails. When I am on social media, machine learning is not just to help me explore new things, new experiences around the world, it also helps me have new relationships supporting me in study and also in my life by providing me suggestions “You may know these people”. Besides, in online shopping: Using algorithms, it analyses my shopping habits and recommends me to related items or products that I would probably like to buy. And for dad, he loves planting, farming, collecting ornamental trees, machine learning will definitely be helpful for him to discover new trees that he has not had.

  <h2 class="w3-wide">Cloud Computing</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>What is cloud computing?</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Based on demand, cloud computing is the provision of computer system resources, data storage (cloud storage) and processing features, no need of the user's direct active management. In different words, cloud computing is used to analyse and express data centers accessible across the Internet to a myriad of users. Prevalent Clouds at the present, also have functions spread from central repositories over different locations.[4]
  </p>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>What is the state of the art of cloud computing?</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Proponents primarily advocates, believe that cloud computing helps companies to upgrade applications, run reliably and handle data more rapidly, with improved manageability and decreased errors. Cloud storage helps one to shift services more effectively to accommodate constant shifts and unpredictable demand, delivering processing capacity. Cloud computing is different from other computing models, such as global computing, Internet computing, where cloud computing relies exclusively on customers as a hub. Cloud computing has five excellent features: on-demand self-help, large network connectivity, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and calculated service. First of all, we would cover on-demand self-service, as the definition of the name itself, customers are a full initiative of access. Cloud infrastructure automatically offers consumers with computing capabilities, including network storage. The second of five functionality is large network connectivity, which enables people to access and utilize the cloud on every form of gadget, such as smartphones, laptops, computers, etc., regardless of places, as long as the Internet remains. The next function is Resource pooling, which means that users are willing to access the facilities offered and that shared infrastructure, including storage, processing and storage, can be modified on the basis of consumer needs. Rapid elasticity, features may be supplied and enabled elastically and automatically, depending on the customer. And last but not least, Measured Service utilizes measurement capability to actively track and optimize resource use by cloud services, such as active user accounts. The usage of resources should be controlled, regulated and registered, providing both the provider and the customer of the service used with responsibility.[6]
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">There are 3 dominant types of cloud computing services such as Infrastructure as a Service(Iaas), Platform as a service(Paas), Software as a service(Saas) where IaaS is the most simple one and each higher model summarizes from the details of the lower model. Firstly, Infrastructure as a service, it is virtually the same as a conventional data center. Cloud services utilize virtualization software for supplying their customers with flexible computing tools, such as servers, networks and data. This is positive for consumers since their machinery would not have to be imported and their parts handled. Secondly, Platform as a service as known as Paas, an Internet-based model for development of software. This provides the possibility to design, configure, validate and deploy applications with a network of interconnected device modules and resources. Without care for infrastructure, middleware and OS maintenance, customers rely on app creation and data. And the third type of cloud computing service is Saas as known as Software as a service which allows users to work and access without any concern of stability or app functioning.[7]
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">There are 4 necessary models to deploy cloud computing. First of all, that is public cloud, it is open to the general public and everyone is able to use it. Public cloud is extremely beneficial because of Control of haze-free infrastructure, strong degree of scalability, price savings and being available 24/7. The second model is private cloud, private and public cloud are quite similar in those architectures. Unlike a public cloud, though only one individual corporation has a private cloud. This is why it is often referred to as an internal or company model. The advantage of private cloud is superior protection feature, privacy and security and only people who created it are able to access resources. The third element to deploy cloud computing is community cloud, just like a private model but the main distinction is the number of participants. While a company has a private cloud server, a range of businesses of common histories share a community cloud platform and associated services. And the last model but not least which is hybrid cloud, it combines the best functionalities of the other three models(public, private, community), It helps enterprises to combine and balance the aspects of the 3 styles better in order to serve their needs.[8]
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Cloud computing provides many advantages to the business. It lets companies set up an office that is virtual, meaning employees can communicate with their organization anywhere. Changing to cloud computing may decrease the fee of controlling and maintaining IT systems. Rather than purchasing a huge amount of expensive machines and equipment for storing data, companies can save money by using the features of cloud computing service. A few operating costs can be mentioned to reduce: device updating, new hardware and applications costs, salaries for the specialists, energy costs. [9]
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Cloud storage software like Google Drive, Onedrive and iCloud can be shown to be really essential to anyone regardless of ages at present in terms of studying, daily life, and also work. I like the ease of Cloud Computing with its Storage facilities. It helps me preserve important records, pictures, and film files online, especially on iCloud, Google Photos or Google Drive. By saving all of these memories in my online cloud storage, I no longer have a bit of concern of losing them in any accidental situation such as losing my phone. It is not just to help me store data, it also frees up space for local files in my computer where I put a lot of heavy work in it such as coding files, editing videos, pictures.
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Furthermore, with the large network connectivity feature of cloud computing, the usage of transferring information through USB or portable hard drive from a laptop is less than before, I now just need to upload all my works online and then completely able to utilize the cloud on every form of gadget as long as my device has connection to the internet.This is critical in order to avoid the destruction of important data induced by my carelessness. The mentioned helpful features have improved my style of storing data and cloud apps that are important in my devices, so I can be versatile everywhere, every time.
  </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">In my study, cloud storage also plays a significant role. For instance, Github can be seen as a cloud storage or online repository. Thanks to it, I and my friends, my teammates are extremely convenient in discussing, helping each other, exchanging assignments or media data. Cloud storage makes it simple and comfortable to store important experiences by having my family bring memory links to family members.
