    The feedback that I got from friends are extremely specific to me and especially useful for my project. It gives me an expression, an opinion from others or can be seen as customer’s point of view based on the description of my project idea. In their feedback, they specifically say what they like about my application and what they that could help me improve the qualification and functionality of my project. For example, one of my friends say that he really like the idea of mentioning COVID-19 in the project, he admits that this grocery online shopping application will play an important role in reducing cases of coronavirus and helpful during the social-distancing regulation. Another person seriously indicates a problem of my project which is the differentiation from other apps. Although she is interested in the recipes that will be suggested when buying a product, but it is not enough to make the customers see the true value of the application. I totally agree with both perspectives, it is not just to help me see what customers probably like and identify the missing and the problems that I need to change or improve for my project. In the future, I may read these feedbacks again because it tells me customers’ demand, what I have already built in order to develop, improve it better.
